"My will shall shape the future. Whether I fail or succeed shall be no man's doing but my own. I am the force; I can clear any obstacle before me or I can be lost in the maze. My choice; my responsibility; win or lose, only I hold the key to my destiny." - Elaine Maxwell.

				<h2>Introducing D-FLEX</h2>
				<p>Occasionally technologies arrive that are truly innovative, creating clear technical progression and forever changing the markets that they are used in. Consider Velcro or Gore-Tex, product designs that were so influential that they became generic brands, household names and the de-facto standards without direct competition.
</p>
<p>
These products are successful because they work in a way that others could not. They are successful commercially because the complexity of manufacture was solved and they have become increasingly valuable through powerful brand recognition.
</p>
<p>
D-FLEX&reg; is an elegant idea, beautifully realised. It is a game changer &#8211; a complete technology, ready for production and offering properties and performance so different that the fishing rod market will be forever changed.
</p>
<p>
When D-FLEX&reg; is launched every conventional, circular fishing rod will become a thing of the past. D-FLEX&reg; is the shape of things to come. D-FLEX&reg; is the Difference.

<p>D-FLEX Technology is enabled by the elegance of its shape, providing different properties which are uniquely favourable to fishing rods. </p>

<p>The shape provides flexibility on one side, allowing the fishing rod to bend more readily.</p>

<p>While, conversely, being more rigid, and stronger on the other side - adding power and control during casting.</p>
