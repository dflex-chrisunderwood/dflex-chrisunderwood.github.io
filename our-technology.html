			<h3>Introducing &#8216;The Difference&#8217;</h3>
				<p>D-FLEX&reg; technology offers to transform fishing rod design, changing and redefining the properties and performance of fishing rods in ways that could not previously be envisaged. It is a quantum shift from old to new. It can do this through the intrinsic properties of its unique shape &#8212; illustrated above.
</p>
<p>
The D-FLEX&reg; shape offers characteristics that are impossible to achieve with existing circular rods, regardless of the materials used in manufacture. The apparent, elegant simplicity of the D-FLEX&reg; design belies the considerable challenges involved in developing this technology - what was originally a very complicated problem now has a very simple, yet scientifically sophisticated solution.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Fishing rods made with D-FLEX&reg; technology have the following outstanding performance characteristics:</strong>
</p>







<div class="internal_column_one">
			<h3>Differential Flex</h3>
				<p>D-FLEX&reg; performance characteristics are a consequence of the way the shape imparts a differential in flexural rigidity, producing more flexibility in one direction and more rigidity in the other. It is from this differential in flexibility that D-FLEX&reg; takes both its name and unique attributes.
</p>
<p>
For fishing rods this creates new possibilities. Fisherman will appreciate the enhanced capability of a spinning rod that can provide the benefit of rigidity when casting yet increased flexibility when playing a fish. But for a fly rod, for example, the opposite configuration may be considered to be more beneficial or preferable. The attributes of the rod can be chosen simply by varying the orientation of the D-FLEX&reg; shape.
</p>
<p>
In comparison, any conventional fishing rod has now become a poor compromise of conflicting requirements.
</p>
</div>








<div class="internal_column_two">
			<h3>Power</h3>
				<p>With D-FLEX&reg;, casting is more controllable, accurate and powerful.
</p>
<p>
D-FLEX&reg; enhances directional accuracy through a highly preferred plane of bending. The power of the cast is amplified by the intrinsic rigidity characteristics promoting greater efficiency as the casting effort is transferred through the rod. The result is a more controlled cast with less effort on the part of the caster.
</p>
<p>
Another example of the D-FLEX&reg; effect is that any design of conventional fly rod may generally be reclassed to a higher AFTM flyline rating solely by adopting the D-FLEX&reg; cross section and changing nothing else.
</p>
<p>
D-FLEX&reg; extends the boundaries of rod performance beyond conventional limits and into new and unexplored territory.
</p>
</div>







<div class="internal_column_three">
			<h3>Lightness</h3>
				<p>D-FLEX&reg; unlocks the potential for completely new fishing rod designs to be developed. In particular, rods can be made that are lighter whilst still maintaining equivalent power or casting weight ratings of otherwise like for like conventional designs.
</p>
<p>
The traditional approach to rod design balances overall dimensions and degrees of taper with grades and amounts of materials. But by also incorporating D-FLEX&reg;, rods can now be developed and built using less volume of material for similar performance.
</p>
<p>
Conventional rod design has been superceded, overtaken because there is now a new design tool for innovative rod designers to exploit - D-FLEX&reg;.
